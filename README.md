 🌍 Sarkari Mitra – AI Agent for Welfare Schemes  

Sarkari Mitra is an empathetic, multilingual AI agent that bridges the gap between citizens and government welfare schemes in India. Its mission is to ensure that poor, uneducated, and digitally unaware people can discover, understand, and apply for the schemes they are eligible for — without being lost in bureaucracy. 

✨ Key Features  
- 📝 Profile Creation – Collects basic details (name, state, gender, occupation, etc.) to personalize scheme discovery.  
- 🤖 Smart Eligibility Matching – AI matches user profiles with central and state welfare schemes.  
- 💬 Simple Explanations – Explains schemes in plain Hindi, English, or a mix — avoiding legal jargon.  
- ⚡ Autonomous Application – Pre-fills forms using Aadhaar, bank account, and personal info securely.  
- 🌐 Multi-Language Support – Designed for India’s diversity, making it usable for first-time digital users.  
- ✅ Trusted Sources – Fetches scheme info directly from official `.gov.in` and `.nic.in` portals.  

🚀 Workflow  
1. Onboarding – User provides name and state.  
2. Profile Enrichment – AI listens for keywords like farmer, pregnant, poor, student, woman etc.  
3. Scheme Discovery – AI displays matching schemes in easy-to-read cards with:  
   - Scheme Name  
   - Benefits  
   - [Learn More] + [Apply Now] buttons  
4. Form Filling – Clicking “Apply Now” opens a pre-filled application form.  
5. Submit & Track – User confirms & submits, minimizing manual work.
